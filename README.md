Secure Communication by 1AM
Anonymouse is a prototype communcation app
that uses the Multipeer Connectivity framework
to send messages to local peers without using 
infrastructure networks. 

Anonymouse is designed to be a microblogging app that is
resistant to network blocking and censorship.

Anonymouse is the iOS prototype equivalent of 1AM's 
previously designed Shout! for Android.
