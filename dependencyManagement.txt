This branch is using Cocoapods <https://cocoapods.org/> for easier dependency management.

For first timers, please do the following:

- install cocoapods on your Mac with "sudo gem install cocoapods"
- cd into the anonymouse project directory where a file called Podfile exists and then install dependencies with "pod install"
- open the .xcodeworkspace file (VERY IMPORTANT)
- find the CryptoSwift.frameworks file under the pod directory on the side bar
- Open the frameworks file in folder and move it up one folder
- repeat steps 4-5 with the Alamofire.frameworks file
- build and run as usual
